The <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build offering:
- Very high burst damage thanks to <Skill name="Sic Em"/>.
- Strong party buffs with <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> and other stances.
- High crowd control (CC) with <Skill id="46432"/>, <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="Overbearing Smash"/>, <Skill name="Path of Scars"/> etc.
- Strong reflect capabilities with <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>, which comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv).


The build is rather self-sufficient due to:

- Personal <Boon name="Quickness"/> from <Trait name="livefast"/>.
- Boon extension from <Trait name="Essence of speed"/> and <Skill name="We heal as one"/>.
- Easy access to condition cleanse with <Skill name="Bear Stance"/>.

This build benefits from slaying potions and slaying sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

### Pets
| | |
| --- | --- |
| <Skill id="46432" size="big" disableText/> | [Pig](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Pig) is the best option for damage due to <Skill id="41406"/>.

| <Skill id="43548" size="big" disableText/> | [Red Moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Red_Moa) is a slight personal damage loss compared to Pig, but brings <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> with <Skill id="43548"/>, which also deals good damage and procs <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/>. |
| <Skill id="73938" size="big" disableText/> | [Warclaw](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Warclaw) provides substantial CC as well as good damage on a low cooldown  with <Skill id="73938"/>.

### Weapon Sets
#### Weapon Set 1
- **Hammer** is the standard weapon choice for most encounters except a few cases in very fast kills. It brings very strong damage skills with optional CC and Boon strip. You can still precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> with Longbow before the start of a fight for extra burst.

  Standard Hammer Skills:
  <Skill id="63118" size="big"disableText/><Skill id="63335" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63075" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63131" size="big" disableText/><Skill id="63208" size="big" disableText/>
  - If you need some extra CC, swap Hammer 5 to <Skill id="63330"/>. This is particularly useful on Artsarriv and MAMA.
  - If you do not need the CC or <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> proc, swap Hammer 3 to <Skill id="63197"/>. It also strips 2 boons.

- **Spear** is an alternative with strong damage and access to <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> through <Skill id="73110"/> & <Skill id="73030"/>. requires making good use of <Effect name="Stealth"/> for its *Stealth Attack* skills.
- **Longbow** is taken on encounters where phase timings allow you to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> into the phase and there is enough time to swap back to your Longbow and reset your burst outside of active phases. If you find yourself stuck on Longbow at points in a fight where you need damage, there is probably a better option.
- **Mace/Mace** is a less bursty alternative to Hammer. It requires making good use of the cooldown reset and medium damage buff granted by *Force of Nature*. This can make it difficult to be flexible and adapt to situations when playing Maces.
- **Greatsword** is an alternative to Hammer for players who do not have access to [Secrets of the Obscure](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Secrets_of_the_Obscure) or want access to an evade with <Skill name="Swoop"/> and a block with <Skill name="Counterattack"/>. It requires pairing the extra *Attack of Opportunity* damage after <Skill id="12525"/> with strong single hit skills.
- **Axe/Warhorn** is another more niche alternative to Hammer on some encounters. It is typically paired with Sword/Axe as the other weapon set.

#### Weapon Set 2
- **Axe/Axe** is the recommended choice as an Axe weapon set. Mainhand Axe provides strong skills with ranged capabilities and does not have animation locks.
- **Sword/Axe** is an alternative that comes with stronger auto attacks, temporary 120 <Attribute name="Power"/> from <Trait name="Strider's Strength"/>, extra mobility,  and access to an evade with <Skill name="Serpent's Strike"/>. This comes at the cost of weaker skills, melee range and animation locks. It is **not** recommended to play mainhand Sword in low gravity.

*Note: What weapon variations you use heavily depends upon the encounter, fight duration and group you are playing with. Optimally there is no single weapon choice that fits all scenarios, so take into acount the possible variables, or play the weapons that you enjoy using.*

#### Additional Gear Options
- <Item id="103574"/> as an alternative to <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/> in heavy CC fights.
- <Item name="Relic of the Dragonhunter"/> for fights where you can cast <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> at the start of every phase (e.g. Skorvald).
- Warhorn for <Boon name="Might"/> pre-stacking. <Item name="Concentration" type="Sigil"/> can be slotted as sigil.
- Weapons with specific slaying sigils like <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/> and/or <Item name="Night" type="Sigil" />. See the [Cheat Sheet](/guides/cheat-sheet) and [Power Soulbeast CM Guide](/cm-guides/ranger/power-soulbeast).
- Weapons with <Item name="Severance" type="Sigil"/> for certain encounters in fast groups (e.g. Artsariiv). Check the [Power Soulbeast CM Guide](/cm-guides/ranger/power-soulbeast) for more information.

### Situational Skills
| | |
| --- | --- |
| <Skill name="Signet of the Wild" size="big" disableText/> | Your standard 3rd utility, acting as a passive damage increase by granting increased <Attribute name="Ferocity"/>. |
| <Skill name="Moa Stance" size="big" disableText/> | All boons that are applied during its uptime last longer. Great for prestacking. Can also be run in fight with <Trait name="Leader of the Pack"/> to allow other players to run more offensive builds (e.g. on Ensolyss). |
| <Skill name="Bear Stance" size="big" disableText/> | A personal condition cleanse, also for allies when playing <Trait name="leaderofthepack"/>. Very handy in [Captain Mai Trin](/fractals/captain-mai-trin-boss), [Artsariiv](/fractals/shattered-observatory), and during any fractal with <Instability name="Afflicted"/>. |
| <Skill name="Healing Spring" size="big" disableText/> | A party-wide condition cleanse and a [water  field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Water_field). An alternative to <Skill name="Bear Stance"/> when playing <Trait name="Oppressive Superiority"/> or when the party benefits from the water field. The same situations as described for <Skill name="Bear stance"/> apply here. |
| <Skill name="Dolyak Stance" size="big" disableText/> | A source of <Boon name="Stability"/>, party-wide with <Trait name="Leader of the Pack"/>. Can be taken during <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/> days and in T4s such as [Chaos](/fractals/chaos-isles). |
| <Skill name="Storm Spirit" size="big" disableText/> | An additonal source of CC and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>. Also deals a decent amount of damage. |
| <Skill name="Stone Spirit" size="big" disableText/> | A source of party-wide <Boon name="Aegis"/>. Can allow your group to ignore specific attacks on several encounters (e.g. MAMA, Artsariiv). |
| <Skill name="Frost Spirit" size="big" disableText/> | A source of party-wide <Boon name="Resistance"/>. Can be used during prestacking to counter <Condition name="Fear"/>, <Condition name="Weakness"/> and <Condition name="Blinded"/>. |
| <Skill name="Signet of the Hunt" size="big" disableText/> | A source of short <Effect name="Superspeed"/> that allows you to perform skips in combination with <Item id="85244"/>. |
| <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr" size="big" disableText/> | A source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> and longer <Effect name="Superspeed"/> that allows you to perform skips in combination with <Item id="85244"/>.|
| <Skill name="Signet of Stone" size="big" disableText/> | A 100% incoming damage reduction. Can be used to perform the skip for the left path in [Deepstone](/fractals/deepstone). |

<Divider text="Gameplay"/>

<Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> focuses on fitting damage into the 10 second burst window of <Skill name="Sic Em"/>. Besides that it tries to ensure high uptime on several modifiers:
- <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> is gained for 10 seconds after using any hard CC skill. See the defiance bar damage table above.
- <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/> is gained for 6 seconds after hitting a weapon skill with 20+ seconds cooldown. See the list below.
- <Trait name="Loud Whistle"/> is active while you are above 90% health.

You want to **always** be in <Skill name="Beastmode"/> when dealing damage. A lot of attributes and modifiers are tied to it. Besides manually using <Skill name="Leave Beastmode"/>, you will get kicked out of <Skill name="Beastmode"/> when your [Rigorous Certainty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rigorous_Certainty) (cheat death) granted by a *Mistlock Singularity* activates.

For your <Skill name="Sic Em"/> burst make sure you are in <Skill name="Beastmode"/> and if possible have all of the 3 modifiers mentioned above. On top of that it is beneficial to align the burst with moments where the target takes increased damage, for example when <Effect name="Exposed"/> or <Control name="Stun"/> are present on the target. <Control name="Stun"/> increases your damage dealt when playing with <Item id="24868"/>. Your Skills will also deal slightly more damage when hitting on a weapon set with Axe or Sword due to <Trait name="Honed Axes"/> and <Trait name="Striders Strength"/>.

Several of your skills may interrupt the previous skill cast or can be interrupted by most other skills. Timing these casts correctly is of interest for good <Specialization name="Soulbeast" text="Power Soulbeast"/> gameplay. See the lists of interrupts and channels below. Since it is an instant cast skill, <Skill name="Sic Em"/> can be used during the cast of other skills.

#### Extra Notes
- <Trait name="Essence of Speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live Fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly Impact"/> extends your boons. The healing skill <Skill name="We Heal As One"/> allows you to gain a copy of each boon on yourself while in <Skill name="Beastmode"/>. Both of these can help maintain boons on yourself.
- <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr"/> and <Skill name="Signet of the hunt"/> in combination with the <Item id="85244"/> allows you to move extremely fast and is useful for a few skips. Check the [Fractal Guides](/fractals) for specific skips. Superspeed will also override the speed decrease when carrying treasure in [Siren's Reef](/fractals/sirens-reef).

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill Usage"/>
<Warning>

Golem rotations from Raids are generally suboptimal in Fractals due to being optimized for sustained DPS. In Fractals players need to adapt their rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase or specific burst windows like <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### Traits
<Traits traits1Id="32" traits1="Beastmastery" traits1SelectedIds="1072,1047,1066" unembossed/>

Your other train lines remain the same as on land. The reason for swapping traits here is to provide a 10% damage increase and cooldown reduction on Spear skills.

### Underwater Rotation
For a DPS rotation the same rules apply as on land: try to fit lots of damage into <Skill name="Sic Em"/> and try to line up your burst with your modifiers and <Effect name="Exposed"/> if possible.

Start on Harpoon Gun and use <Skill id="12528"/> (Harpoon Gun 3) and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> (Harpoon Gun 4) to precast damage into <Skill name="Sic Em"/>.

Use <Skill name="Tail Lash"/> (Devourer F1) to proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> and <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/> for every <Skill name="Sic Em"/> burst. <Skill name="Worldly Impact"/> (F3) is your only other source of <Item name="Relic of Fireworks"/> underwater. An alternative is to swap to <Item name="Relic of the Thief"/>, but do not forget to swap back later!

During damage phases camp Spear since <Skill name="Man o war"/> (Spear 5), <Skill name="Swirling Strike"/> (Spear 2), as well as your auto-attack chain deal good damage. You can swap back to Harpoon gun at the start of split-phases to range adds as well as allow you to repeat your opening burst when the split-phase ends.

#### Bonus Tips
- If you know a blockable attack is coming use <Skill name="Counterstrike"/> (Spear 4) for damage and an additional <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> proc.
- At the end of a phase you can use <Skill id="12528"/> (Harpoon Gun 3) and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> (Harpoon Gun 4) again.
- You can use <Skill name="Surging maw"/> to quickly reach or come back from the adds during the Jellyfish fight of [Aquatic Ruins](/fractals/aquatic-ruins).
